I like building things. So this blog will be about that, mostly. You can find me [here](https://aamnakhan.com/).

The name of this blog is inspired by a piece of dialouge from "Storm - The Animated Movie", a short film by Tim Minchin. I want it to serve as a reminder of how little I know and how constant a state that is going to be.

Do watch the short film, it's great!
