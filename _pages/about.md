I want to write stuff that I was hoping to find on the internet. So expect a lot of how-tos. And some rants because a lot of things make me angry.

You can find me, the person responsible for this blog, [here](https://aamnakhan.com/).

The name of this blog is inspired by a piece of dialouge from "Storm - The Animated Movie", a short film by Tim Minchin. I want it to serve as a reminder of how little I know and how constant a state that is going to be.

Do watch the short film, it's great!
